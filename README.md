# GoodNight
A game written in cpp with GUI, multiplayer but on single computer
## How to play the game?
In order to start the game, you have to decide how many poeplel are going to play(it can be donefrom 1 to 5 players). Each one of you will get a color and the rest colors that are not used will be placed semi-randomly on the game plate.
When the game starts, each player will get 3 tokens to place on the board, on the line that is highlighted and indicated by a cyan token on the right. Each player has to place one token when it is his turn.
Whan all th tokens are placed, all the placed tokens will be grayed out and the free spaces will disappear.
Each player will now have to chose one token at a time to eliminate. Remembering the positions of your tokens can be useful :)
When only 1  token is left, it will be revealed which color won, it can either be a player or an NPC.
Afterwards you will be asked if you want to exit or rather play again.

The easiest way to open the project is by using Qt Creator and at lest the version 6.1.
